# DodgeTheBullet
ProgMeth Project

Welcome to our new project

Temporary name is DodgeTheBullet but this will be change to be associated with a theme later.

It's a TWIN-STICKS SHOOTER game with BULLETHELL element.

In future, we will need to add monster types and skills

BUT NOW, we need to implement these feature first to run as an engine :
    1.  Bullet
    
		2.  Entity (player, enemy, boss)
    
		3.  Controlling (using aswd and arrows)
    
		4.  Rendering (include models)

Some form of communication :
    
		1.  When you making change, pls list your change like DotA patch notes
    
		2.  Write DATE in each sync in form of [dd/mm/yyyy] ex. [06/12/2016]

		3.  When you doing some feature in the list above, add status and your name of that objective 
			in the front of the number in "features" file
     				 ex. [Implementing/MooMoo] 1.  whatsoever
      		list of available status : [implementing], [complete], [bugFix]

GL:HF :)
